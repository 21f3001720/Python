'''
A sequence of five words is called magical if the ith word is a substring of the (i+1)th word for every i in the range 1â‰¤i<5. Accept a sequence of five words as input, one word on each line. Print magical if the sequence is magical and non-magical otherwise.

Note that str_1 is a substring of str_2 if and only if str_1 is present as a sequence of consecutive characters in str_2.
